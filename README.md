This is my very first react project. I want to build the famous todo app with react.

### `How to use`

Clone the repo<br />
go to the directory where you've cloned it <br />
run <b>npm start</b> <br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
